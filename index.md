### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was one of my favorites as it simulated a number guessing game.  The user would input a number, and the program would determine if the player guessed the right number, and also offer a second attempt. I was able to write if and else statements to determine if the number inputted was too low or high from the winning number.
    

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was another favorite as it observed values inputted into the command line to carry out the code instead of the user having to manually input information. The program ensured that the amount of values in putted was less than 4 to run the code. The words inputted in the command line were used to form a sentence that helped create a snadwich order. 


* Lab 7

    Lab 7 was my favorite as it used checked parking availability based on the times inputted in the command line. This lab had great practical application in the the real-life scenario as it used if & else statements to implement time based conditions for parking avaliability. Based on the command line input, the code was able to determine if parking was allowed or not.
