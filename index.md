### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was one of my favorites as it simulated a number guessing game.  The user would input a number and the program would determine if the player guessed correcly, and if not, offer a second attempt. I was able to write if & else statements to determine if the number inputted was too low or high from the winning number.
    

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was another favorite as it introduced writing values on the command line to carry out the code instead of manually inputting information. The program ensured that the amount of values inputted was less than 4 using command_line.size (determines count), to run the code. The words inputted in the command line were used to form a sentence that helped create a snadwich order. 


* Lab 7

    Lab 7 was my favorite as it had a scenario based practical application to provide parking availability based on the information written on the command line. This lab used boolean values and various operators to impose conditions based on the given time, street, and day to check for availability. Based on the command line input, the code was able to determine if parking was allowed or not.
